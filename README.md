## Cloning

Clone repo to preferred directory.
Navigate to project directory on terminal, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I got good practice on using React hooks,especially useState and useEffect. Knowing when and how to use conditional rendering. Overall, Figuring out the logic for this project was fun.


Struggled with having NaN and Infinity show up as results, Just thought to try this in `Calculate.jsx`. It worked! ðŸ¤£

```js
<span>
  ${isNaN(amount) || !isFinite(amount) ? "0.00" : amount}
</span>
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I intend to get more practice on react hooks, explore more react concepts. Improve my code and file structuring.
